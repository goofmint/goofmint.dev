During the 2025-2026 New Year holidays, I thought about working on some project. However, even when I tried to have AI agents work in parallel, things didn't go smoothly... So I decided to start with something more manageable—launching my own portfolio site.

The projects I'm personally working on are summarized on the [Projects](/en/projects) page. Most of them are open source, though some are not.

2026 is shaping up to be a year of significant change for me personally. The change is already decided, but the announcement will take a little more time. In that sense, it will be a challenging year, and I'm more excited than I've been in years.

That said, 2025 was also a year where major upheavals caused by AI were felt, so it looks like things will remain unsettled.

## January 1st

On New Year's Day 2026, I went to [STARBUCKS RESERVE® ROASTERY TOKYO](https://www.starbucks.co.jp/reserve/roastery/), had some coffee, and bought a Daruma doll. This year's Daruma are the blue and red ones in front; the one in the back is from 2025.

STARBUCKS RESERVE® ROASTERY only has 6 locations worldwide: Japan, plus 3 in the US (Seattle, New York, Chicago), Shanghai, and Milan. I was able to visit New York in 2025, so I hope I can make it to at least one more location this year.

By the way, even though I went to STARBUCKS RESERVE® ROASTERY at 9:30 in the morning, there were almost no seats available...

## January 2nd

Either from something I ate or otherwise, I got food poisoning from late at night... I wasn't completely immobilized though, so since I had made a reservation, I went to [THE MOVEUM YOKOHAMA by TOYOTA GROUP](https://global.toyota/info/themoveum/) (hereafter MOVEUM YOKOHAMA). MOVEUM YOKOHAMA is a video-based museum (immersive museum) created by Toyota at the site where the Gundam Factory used to be. It just opened on December 20, 2025, so it hasn't even been a month yet.

Basically, it's video art that you can watch while seated, but there's no explanation about the works on display, so I think it's better to know the background of the works beforehand to enjoy them. Actually, if you don't know, it might be a tough time.

For the current exhibition, I recommend videos like these:

### Gustav Klimt

By the way, they're very generous about allowing photos and video recording of the video installations. However, live streaming is not allowed.

What personally made me happy was getting a museum notebook (that's what I call them—notebooks of the size commonly sold at museums).

## January 3rd

Thanks to sleeping continuously since coming back on the 2nd, my condition improved considerably. Still, without pushing myself too hard, I relied on AI agents to create this portfolio.

I had already decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which I personally like, but I was thinking about what theme to use. I picked out a few, but elaborate themes weren't easy to customize, so I gave up on them. So I decided to have AI agents build one from scratch, and this worked out surprisingly well. Since I proceeded step by step from the beginning, it was easy to grasp the overall picture, and things progressed smoothly.

The website is deployed on Cloudflare Workers. While Jekyll is often associated with GitHub Pages, I personally prefer using Cloudflare Workers because the cache duration is rather long. When merged to the main branch, it gets deployed.
